OpenTSD July 2012

This is an attempt to develop an RFC 5544 (Syntax for Binding Documents with Time-Stamps) compliant extension 
for the OpenSSL project.

The license for the patch is the same as that of OpenSSL, you can find it at http://www.openssl.org/source/license.html.

The current status is very very very preliminary. For now, you can only verify a non detached TimeStampedData file 
without MetaData and only a single RFC 3161 type of evidence is supported.
The patch is based on the latest OpenSSL-1.0.1c version and extends the cms command with a new -timestamp_verify option:

openssl cms -timestamp_verify -in file.xyz.tsd -CAfile TSA_cert.pem -inform DER -out file.xyz
