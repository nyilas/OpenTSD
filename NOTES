To do:

The optional crl field carries a suitable CRL (Certificate Revocation List) demonstrating that the certificate of the TSA 
(Time-Stamping Authority) that issued the TimeStampToken was not revoked at the time when the subsequent element in the 
TimeStampTokenEvidence sequence was added.

-   open the first element of the TimeStampTokenEvidence sequence,
	open the time-stamp token within it and use the hash function that
	was used to obtain it to re-compute the hash of the fields
	indicated in Section 2; if the re-computed hash value matches the
	one within the time-stamp token, continue processing; otherwise,
	the TimeStampedData structure has been modified;
-	validate the temporalEvidence by checking that:
	- each TimeStampToken in the chain does contain the correct digest
	  value (according to the rule described in Section 2) and it was
	  signed by a trusted TSA,
	- the corresponding TSA signing certificate was not revoked at the
	  time when the subsequent TimeStampToken was issued, based on the
	  associated CRL;
